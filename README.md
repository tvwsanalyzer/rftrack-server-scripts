Server scripts for analysis management of RfTrack Measurement Campaigns
=======================================================================

This repository contains the scripts installed on the remote server for the analysis of data collected from RfTrack.

The application RfTrack collects data from a portable spectrum analyzer RFExplorer, transforming tablet or Android smartphones in low cost / low power monitoring systems of TV White Spaces (TVWS) frequencies.

The reports generated by the server are available at this web address:

http://wireless.ictp.it/tvws/

1. Once received the mail containing the data of the measurement campaign, after a few minutes the server can generate analysis reports in two formats, pdf and html.

2. Clicking on the images of the html report, you can view high-resolution versions, or other types of representation of the results.

3. Each report is associated with a download page that provides: two different versions of videos that show the graph of the frequencies recorded by the spectrum analyzer and GPS position on the map, the pdf report, the zip archive containing all the report images and the SQLite database of the measures. At the bottom of the page there are some links about free software tools to manipulate the sqlite databases.

4. The index page displays the number of reports that are currently available. There are two types of indexes: a first table containing references for the last 5 reports that were generated by the server. Scrolling through the index page you can view all reports grouped by country.
